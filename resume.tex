\begin{comment}
{\blocking
My industry experience has exposed me to many fun technologies, fueling my interests in cryptography, statistical computing, and languages.
%I have strong interests in scientific/academic visualization, mathematical modeling, realtime systems, natural language processing, education technologies, and cryptography.
%I perform very well in high stress collaborative environments, inspired by participation in difficult projects and competitions.
%I perform very well in collaborative environments and enjoy participating on challenging projects and competitions
I am a very quick study, as I have adopted a new programming language or tool-set in nearly every challenge I have taken on.
My interest in teaching and writing has granted me strong communication skills, and solid background.
%Info/Code samples available on request.
See my project details at \url{http://probinso.dyn-o-saur.com}.
% You should expect that durning an interview I can answer any question about the projects that I have listed at the end of my resume.

  I am a graduate student at Oregon Health and Sciences University.
  After completing my BS at Western Washington University, and my 4 years
  industry expirience, I have developed strong interests in cryptography,
  statistical computing, and programming languages. I am a very quick study,
  as I have adopted a new or tool-set in nearly every
  challenge I have taken on. My interest in teaching and writing has granted
